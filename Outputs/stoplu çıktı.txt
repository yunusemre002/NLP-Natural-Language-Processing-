 The hotel was dated, but clean. The gentleman at the front desk who checked us in was extremely helpful with directions and itinerary planning. The a/c in the room was not effective at all and none of us slept well because the room was at least 85 degrees. Not impressed with the complementary breakfast. It was the most expensive room during our 2-week vacation, and by far, our least favorite. It is in a great setting, however, with easy access to shops and restaurants. Very short drive into Yosemite National Park.

 The rooms were not terribly expensive, but this is not your all inclusive resort, rather everything costs additional money. Below is detailed review: Front door - pros: upon arrival the doors are held open for us multiple times cons: no one bothered with the doors when we left. Rooms - pros: comfortable beds and nice lake view cons: small fridge, few TV channels, slow internet connections (almost nonexistent at night) broken shower knob upon arrival but it was fixed pretty quick. Pools - pros: we went there for the pool because we have little kids and the kids loved the pools, and there are towels everywhere cons: there were food containers in one of the pools. Kid Zone - pros: it's onsite for the kids cons: expensive and charges hourly per child (ten dollars). Food - like other reviews not that great. Breakfast buffet is nothing special but costs not too far from Vegas buffet prices (eighteen for adults and nine for child). Dinner portions were medium to what I considered small even though we were told one of the dishes were huge and easily shared by two. Shrimp tastes like over frozen, but my fish seems fresh.

 It wasn't horrible but the service was bad they took a 30 deposit that I never got back or wasn't mentioned during booking. The room was decent but had a horrible smell and floors were damp . They said there would be a refrigerator and microwave which they did not have. Said there was cable only had about two channels of cable . The only thing I liked about it was the bed was comfortable. Cheaper isn't always better.

 When we arrived to the hotel we thought it was an abandoned building. The curtains in the windows were in disrepair. There were boards in the windows. It looked like it was a live-in hotel. It is located directly next to a Mcdonalds which is to say they shared a parking lot. The television service was 90 oriental and Hispanic television and we had trouble finding a channel that we could understand. Upon walking into the hotel, we did see a sign that they were doing remodeling. However, we considered going to another hotel because of the shape of this one. We did like the bed which was very comfortable and the room itself was dated but clean.

 I loved the location, gorgeous decor, complimentary coffee and tea in the morning, the pool (although I wish it wasn't shut down for four hours between 10-2), onsite parking with valet and in and out options and nearby restaurants.The check in was a bit rocky because the woman who checked me in took my name, disappeared for 10 minutes to tend to something else, while I thought she was tending to my check in.  She returned and asked me my name again and began the checkout process.  She offered no apology and failed to give me the correct pool hours, which I learned of after i visited the pool ready for a swim only to learn that it was closed for four hours midday.   The management should train its desk staff to be professional, courteous and to know the basic facts of the hotel's amenities.

 During the beginning check in- everything looked very quaint and as if it had a decent amount of value. It appeared as if it were very clean. I went out and had dinner- came back- relaxed, all was well. I was enjoying an infrequent bit of quiet time away from my soon to be ex-wife. However, during my sleep, I was caused to awaken very abruptly because I felt something crawling on me. Not only where they're very small roaches in the bed, but I found some on the walls of the bedroom. This caused me to get up- leave my keys on the coffee table and go home...... crazy at home is preferable to crazy at a hotel. The staff was very nice- extremely personable and friendly. However I don't believe there was anything they could have done at that point that would have made me comfortable. So I left.

 The hotel was nice and looks recently renovated. The front desk staff, both of them, were not welcoming and did not acknowledge any guests unless first talked to. And then when the breakfast came out an hour and a half late, they didn't even take time to tell us even though they saw us pass their desk toward the breakfast area. After finally asking them by breakfast wasn't out 45 minutes after it should have, they told us the cook decided not to come in while saying sorry in the least apologetic tone I've ever heard. The staff that did try and make up the breakfast were very nice and I applaud them for their efforts to make up what was missed. Overall the hotel itself was nice, the rooms were nice, except our bathroom did not have an exhaust fan.

 Americas Best Value Inn has poor service. They screwed me over twice with their Indian Manager. The first time they took my food and put me through a hard time getting it back. The manager Anil P. Motwani was hard to find, I didn't get in contact with him once. When I finally got my food back they kept my chicken. The second time I got screwed over, I check into the hotel around 2 a.m. Saturday morning, the lady at the front desk was not there I had to stand there and wait by that time I got tired and went to see if she was in the bar (The Edge) and there she was. She checked me in and I ask her what time did I have to check out she said Sunday Morning at 11 a.m. so Saturday around 2 p.m. they came and told me I had to check out the room and the manager also stated then We never let people stay over 24 hours. Notice it has only been twelve hours but no worrys because I will discuss this issue with my lawyer.

 We found this hotel to be just perfect for a city break. It was comfortable and clean with very friendly, helpful and knowledgable staff.The only thing that may be a problem for some is the size of the lift, rather small. It's situation is just right, being in a quiet area about 5 minutes walk from transport links into the city and one of those roundabouts that Paris has surrounded by restaurants that cater for just about all budgets. The large cafe was perfect for coffee, crepes and watching life go by and we ate in Hortensia which had excellent food with an individual twist and Le Comptoir D'Alphonse for a classy pizza and very friendly service. One bit of advice I would offer is to get there before 8pm as they fill up very quickly afterwards but we didn't feel rushed or under pressure for our table. We adopted the very pleasant local attitude to relax and enjoy ourselves.

 Up the hierarchy Hotelier Chip Conley developed the Joie de Vivre hotel chain based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs and goal of self-actualization. He wrote the book How Great Companies get their Mojo from Maslow. The Citizen Hotel helped move me a bit up the pyramid, but being in Sacramento couldn't fully bring me to self-actualization. Oh well, can't have everything. It's an old downtown bank turned boutique hotel with dark reds and blacks and great drawings and political cartoons along the wall. The best is the black and white pic of a young buff Arnold Schwarzenegger, shirtless and in speedos, flexing with a group of bridesmaids in the women's bathroom in the parlor. The room was spacious, swanky, sophisticated. Dripping with old school charm and modern day luxuries. An Apple-lovers haven -- iPhone docks, macs in the business center. Dual shower heads, decent products, sitting room with a second flat screen TV (although I learned I had the ADA room). Steamer instead of an iron (LOVE), roomy, cozy, great bed, decent mini-bar. If you are stuck in Sacramento on business or whatever, this hotel is an excellent selection.

 As you walk down the hallway towards your room, there is a powerful smell of something they are using to cover up the 50 years of smoking that is still allowed in the motel.  My room was non smoking, I think that just for the 3 nights I was there.  Areas of no paint on the bathroom walls, holes in the wall, globs of yellow ancient chalking around the toilet bottom.  The shower leaked, drip, drip, drip.  No maid service my second night.  A sticker on the bathroom door from a previous guest.  I woke up in the middle of the night all stuffed up from the noxious air.  I had to kept the air conditioning on all night.  There was a thick layer of dust on the tv console.  The facecloth was like sandpaper.  The towels didn't absorb water...I don't know what they were made of.  If I had paid forty a night I would expect what I got.  This is a one star folks!

The security lock on my room door was broken, but the electronic door lock worked fine.

Because of that incident we were all tired in the morning and my daughter forgot her favorite bear "Algonquin". We called immediately after we realized it was missing. The bear was not found and we know it was left close to the bed. We could only hope that it was passed to another girl that will love him as much as my daughter did.

Around 9:00 I decided to get the kids ready for bed and, based in the condition and cleanliness of the hotel, I decided to look under the sheets on the beds. Between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet, there were bed bugs crawling around...I didn't lift the mattress pad at that point. I called the front desk and told them there was a big problem in our room and when I mentioned the bed bugs, the front desk attendant did not seem surprised and said she would send the manager up to our room. The manager, too, did not seem surprised and said we could change rooms or get a refund. We left the hotel at 9:15 and went to another hotel in Iowa City.

 There were many things that sold me on this hotel. Those who have looked at other hotels around San Antonio know all the extra expenses for parking, breakfast, crazy deposits, and what not. I had a specific list of things that were a must for staying in San Antonio. It had to have free parking, complimentary breakfast, decent pool, nice room. The pool could have been a little more extravagant but it was fine. Parking was easy. The breakfasts were nice with a nice selection of breakfast sandwiches, waffles or pancakes, cereal, pastry items donuts. Milk and Juice and fruit were available as well. I was pleased as well as my family. The staff was super nice and although I didn't order anything, they have a 24/7 kitchen to order food from. The room had plenty of space, A sofa area with a workstation area and another counter for what ever slightly separated from the bed area and bathroom. I thought being fairly close to the airport that we would hear planes but it wasn't the case. My only complaint at all about the place is that I wish the bathroom was a little more updated. Tub drained a little slow and the faucet dripped a bit but the bathroom was fully functional. The location was great. It is just off highway 281 and right across from the Quarry market which has a super nice movie theater, shops and tons of places to eat. One of the places there consists of a Joes Crab Shack which is a + for us. All in all, I think I found a place to stay when we come. Very Happy.

 This was a family vacation. We skied for six days and experienced most of Park City Mountain Resort, including the hike to Jupiter Bowl peak. Our children are in their early 20s, but we saw families of all ages and couples enjoying the resort and its offerings. The one bedroom was spacious, particularly the kitchen and vanity counter space. We spent time skiing, snowshoeing and enjoyed a few meals on Main St in Park City which was vibrant.

 The front desk staff was great and friendly during check-in time and check-out. We stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay. I am not a smoker and this time the outside walkways and parking lot smelled like a smoke pit. The walkways had numerous bucket ashtrays and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around. I do not want to smell nasty cigarette smoke that may cause adverse health problems for me, my wife and toddler. I would suggest having designated smoke areas away from the hotel. I was not impressed with our stay this time round, we only were staying here for one night after our weekly resort stay. The breakfast was good with a variety of foods for all to eat. The breakfast hours were great, 7-10.

 This hotel has not been updated in 50 yrs. Upon check in I needed to take a shower to attend an event. The towels were wet. When I went to the front desk the attendant was eating and with a full mouth she told me that housekeeping had not learned how to use the new machines. She handed me dry towels that were probably as old as the hotel, they were thin and with holes in them. One was even blood stained. As far as cleaniness is concerned the room was filthy. There had to be years of build up of cob webs around the heater. There were pieces of the ceiling on the floor and the bathtub was cracked and stained. Their idea of a continental breakfast was a rotting apple that was in the basket for 3 days and a couple of stale pieces of bread. The hotel was rated a best value and it was far from that. Even at 58 dollars a night it was far from a value. DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!!!!!!

 Great welcome from the reception staff. Great room. Great views from the balcony. It's also very conveniently placed to stroll to the National Park centre and the free shuttle buses to Zion Canyon. The breakfast room is very quirky but gets the job done. Lovely gardens to wander through - we saw mule deer a couple of times. Great!

 Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat. Outside of that, our stay was very nice. The gentleman at the front desk was especially cordial and accommodating.

 From the outside the hotel looks pretty decent. But once u go into the office and u notice the change. The outside seems like the ghetto or projects. Makes u feel uncomfortable and unsafe. I reserved a family room with queen size beds and ended up getting a small room twice as small w 2 twin beds for the same price I wasn't offered a refund of any sort. The management is rude. Then you walk into the rooms, broken beds, non working rusted appliances, tv is nothing but static, the room was not maintained well n to top it off roaches everywhere! We were there for the whole weekend and I asked for extra towels and till today a week later after my trip am still waiting to get my towels. Didn't even bother cleaning the room for us. I can't rate this hotel any lower other wise I would! Stay away ppl worst hotel I've stayed at ever!

 There is remodeling going on at this hotel. When I say that - even the sign had a garbage bag over it. (Luckily the GPS knew where to go). My daughter arrived before I did and checked us both in. When I arrived and went to my room it was marked non-smoking. I went to the desk (with my confirmation) to straighten it out. I was informed that the hotel was sold after I booked my room and it's now a non smoking hotel. I told her that was the only reason I booked the room. She got on her computer and found a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room.

 DO NOT STAY HERE. It is the worst, most dangerous place I have been. The rooms were filthy and it seems that they must rent by the hour by the people that were coming in and out of the place. I did not stay there because I was worried about my safety. I left the room the same day and did not return. The carpet is filthy and sticky, you cannot take off your shoes. The fridge was frosted over with ice and rusted. The toilet paper holder was the back of the toilet. There was no holder, just toilet paper sitting on back of the toilet. There was no phone in the room and after my second time asking for a phone, the person said she had to put in a work order, because people take phones out of the room and they don't know it's gone. It is not a safe place. I was told by a worker that the reason WIFI doesn't work in all areas of the hotel is that someone cut the power lines while trying to steal it. I would have more pictures to upload but my phone died since I spent about an hour on it trying to find a safer place to stay.

 The staff we all very friendly. The room was clean for the most part but the beds were hard and there were many signs of damage in the room (such as holes in the walls and scratches on the tub). Additionally there were hardly any outlets in the room which made it inconvenient for all guests to charge their phones. Breakfast offerings in the morning were adequate but both mornings the attendant had to be found and asked to replenish items. Overall for our purposes the stay was fine with a few minor inconveniences.

When I checked in, the desk clerk was extremely nice and helpful, need more people like this guy in the hospitality industry. There was a coffee maker but no coffee pot, I had requested a wake up call as a backup in case my phone did not sound off, but never received a wake up call, and the internet was dirt slow....

 This was our first visit to the resort and the hotel was ideally placed just in the Centre and very close to the sea and also the restaurants and bars, all of which were really good, although maybe a little more expensive that usual. The hotel was very clean and the food (although we only had breakfast there) was always fresh and hot and plenty of it. We requested a high room with sea view if possible and that is exactly what we got, it was brilliant to wake up and see the sunrise each morning. The balcony would have been perfect if it had enough room for loungers, but was still okay. Our only complaint, and it is a big one, is that the hotel is advertised as having 2 pools and a children's pool and it didn't! The pool area downstairs was always in the shade and therefore the seating area was not very welcoming and the pool too cold to swim in. We thought there was another pool on the rooftop sun terrace and were particularly looking forward to that. But although there were plenty of sun loungers and a lovely Jacuzzi, there was no pool and it did spoil our visit a little as I in particular was looking forward to a daily swim. This really needs addressing if they are going to advertise it as such. Other than that, we had a brilliant holiday and would recommend the hotel - if you aren't bothered about the pool that is!!

 Check in was great. The girl at the counter was really nice and let me check in a little early. Coffee and tea both in the lobby and in the room--along with a microwave and a refrigerator. I booked this hotel because I was a woman travelling alone and I liked the inside corridors. But that safety feature was blown out of the water because they prop the doors at both ends of the hallway open all day. The pool was dirty, but I didn't use it, but if I wanted to, I wouldn't have. In the morning there was a homeless person walking through the hallways and going through the garbage. The decor was old and worn (holes in the draperies), but it appeared passably clean. 2 soups, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, a make-up remover pacakge, Q-tips, and cotton balls were all provided. Breakfast was OK. Lots of pre-packaged food, but the eggs they advertised were obviously powdered--they were in the shape of squares! Cereal, muffins, bread, toaster, no peanut butter, boiled eggs, cheese slices (american), hot sausage and a waffle maker. So that was OK. At 167 with tax it's one of the cheaper places in Sunnyvale and if you're just there for the night because you have to go to family court down the street, it's OK. I have to go there again next month and I'll probably stay here again--but if I had more money, it would NOT be my choice.

 The room was very elegant and cozy. We enjoyed our room decor quite a lot ! Parking was an unexpected difficulty, and frankly started our visit off in an unhappy way. We couldn't even pull up to the hotel in our car due to its position in the street. There is a tiny amount of space for cars to pull into the valet area in the front of the hotel. Once that area is filled with 2-3 cars, there is no where to even pull your vehicle to check in and unload the car. You end up in some garage down the street. Also, the front desk was not helpful when they kept repeating in half broken English, "the valet will help you, the valet will take care of you"-- yeah, maybe if WE COULD GET OUR CAR ANYWHERE NEAR THEM!However, once we finally got to out room, it was lovely. The rest of the staff was very courteous. I didn't appreciate the attitude if the woman at the front desk, but I still enjoyed my stay.

 It's easy to find, has a spacious well appointed lobby and a very helpful staff. This motel became our favorite of the 5 we stayed at during this trip in a price range around 75 fees included. Masterful towel origami by housekeeping, a view of the canal to the lake, a decent continental breakfast with waffles, fruit and yogurt. Nice pool, washers and dryers available and very spacious clean smelling newly appointed rooms. This place is a keeper. 5 stars.

 This motel really doesn't feel safe. The lobby is closed at night with only a small bank teller window to interact with the front desk staff. The parking lot had lots of trash from fast food restaurants next door. My room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it had a huge gap at the bottom through which daylight, and noise passed. The bed was rock hard. The carpet was dirty. The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room. The shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height. The elevator interior is just plywood and creaked as the elevator ascended. This motel offers no amenities other than a single bar of soap and a single bottle of shampoo. The motel is in the process of replacing room carpets. There was debris piled everywhere. Construction noise started at 7:30 a.m. each day.

 Our non-smoking room contained an ash tray and smelled STRONGLY of cigarettes. We informed the front desk but were told no other rooms were available. They had turned away many folks with reservations that night, so we were told we were lucky to have a room. Wow! The closet door was broken. The sink was broken and contained standing water (my husband fixed it). The topper The bed linens had NOT been changed. They contained hair and questionable stains. We had arrived late in the evening, and we were exhausted from two days of driving. It was so disheartening to arrive at this mess. We attempted to find other accommodations for the night, but no local hotels had any vacancies.

 We stayed in Apartment 2, in a building a few houses down the street from the main hotel. The apartment was nicely decorated with a view of the water and a small kitchenette and was perfect for our group of 4 people. The location was walkable to the pedestrian area of Taormina, and the hotel staff recommended us a nice private beach with free shuttle service, which saved us the hassle of driving Taormina's narrow and winding streets and looking for parking.

 Bed was really comfy. The shower had 2 shower heads, one at normal height and one at waist height. I'm not really sure what the purpose of the lower one was, but it felt really nice to have 2 showerheads spraying on me. The only complaint I had was that the TV picture was terrible. Why provide a nice flat screen TV if you aren't going to have HD cable

 I've stayed here before but never will again. There was an independent film being shot in the hotel during my stay, which the hotel never mentioned. They used the pool area for two days and a room just down the hall from mine. Noise and working all night. Then the night they left, the fire alarm went off at 2AM. No fire, just pranksters and the alarm staying on for thirty minutes. I didn't enjoy my stay at all and the hallway carpet seemed damp and smelled. There are too many other great hotels in this area to go here again.

 Room 1013 - Lighting issues, broken lamp, TV did not function properly, window shade in the bathroom would not easily roll-down, because its chain that rolls it up/down was duct-taped together. I tried to connect my laptop via HDMI cable, it would not work. My reservation stated 3 guests allowed. However, my fianc was not allowed entry without extra charge. Sent email to Hotel manager, he started talking about money and Santo Domingo policies. Customer Service did NOT exist in his book. It's unfortunate that I have to rate this hotel's staff very low because of one person in charge of it. A luxurious American Brand with such low standards: I am very disappointed. I will cut my honors card in half and will send it to its CEO.

One thought he was a comedian -- not very funny after the first 2 minutes.Lots of dogs there (which is nice and welcomed) but I have been to other Kimpton Hotels where the dogs were more welcomed with treats, beds, named greeting. It was nice at Monaco but had better treatment at other Kimpton Hotels.

The staff and in particular the head concierge Giuliano deserve 5 stars PLUS for their consummate care of guests. Every request handled with ease from booking restaurant reservations, water taxis AND our renewal wedding vows on the occasion of our 25th anniversary at the famed Ste. Maria Di Miracoli. It doesn't get anymore perfect than this. I wonder sometimes if it was just a dream but then I look at the photos we took and realize it wasn't a dream but a magical reality.

 Location is terrific.Check in was fairly easy and quick.Room was nice. I got the 2 double bed room.There were a few quirks however. You have to ask for a separate mini-bar key, which i guess is acceptable and may be more common than i experience. Also, the pool is open odd hours - for example not before 10am on Saturday and Sunday and not between 10 and 2 weekdays, and they actually enforce this by not allowing the doors to open. The fitness equipment all worked, with the exception of the televisions attached to them. Also, TV advertised pay per view, but they must have changed it so it is not available. And finally, internet of course was expensive. i honestly believe i this day and age that wi-fi should be free.

 The hotel is nice I'll give it that.but we got NO sleep cause they put us on the first floor...sadly the first floor is all the pet friendly rooms. No one told us! After driving (not walkable) into town to find food and entertainment we got back late and after lying down neighboring dogs began howling and barking. It literally went all night long as if they were left in the rooms by themselves. Was horrible! We had no pets with us so no reason to of been stuck on the pet friendly floor. In the morning at check out (cause we were told at checkin no other rooms avail hotel was full) the clerk laughed to herself about it and said yup that happens on the first floor a lot. Ugh. Was horrible had to gonto work meetings tired and exhausted cause we got no rest. The hotel overall is the only one I would stay in that are but on another floor.

 Hotel was average for what we were being charged. The rooms were clean, however, the furniture is dated. The ice machines on all floors was not working and I was advised a contractor had been called. However, there was no effort to perhaps buy bags of ice to have for guests.

 The people above us were really loud. The floor stomping was over the top. The view was not at all as expected since all we could view was the gondola. The only other issue was lack of privacy as the folks that were on the gondola could see right into the room. I confirmed the view into the room from when my husband and I took the gondola ourselves. Perhaps the place was clean because you had the experience as though company was coming and on thei way.

 We learned quickly that what we call Florence is Firenze in Italy! Thankfully we got off the right train. We booked the hotel because of the proximity of location to the train station. Upon arrival I turned on my map app, and it was more like a 15 minute walk, so we opted to get a cab with all of our luggage. The location was good, and had many shops and restaurants around. The hotel is an older property, and still maintained nicely. The hotel doesn't have a door person to open the door for you or greet you. Check in was fast, and we were upgraded to a suite, nice touch! We also really liked the electronic roll down blinds for blocking out sunlight. This was a fun feature! The breakfast room was amazing, and had very good food!

 I wasn't treated like a citizen I booked a suite at new The Citizen Hotel for New Year's Eve. My husband and I were recently married and didnt get to take a honeymoon, so this was our exciting getaway. When we got to our room it was clear that the room we reserved was not the room they gave us. We were treated extremely rudely by all staff members and it was obvious that they gave our room to someone else and made no effort to fix the situation. I told them I was disappointed and considering checking out. At that point the manager said that I should check out and refused to speak with me face-to-face. We then left the hotel feeling like we were not citizens at all and that they didn't care about us as guests. I have never been treated that way in my life.

 For what we paid it was a great value. The night manager on duty was super helpful. Breakfast was fine as there was cold and hot foods available. No complaint about the noise, it was pretty quiet. Pool was quiet the time we were there, which was half the week. The beds were a bit worn, but that was the only complaint i have. Easy accessible location near plenty of restaurants and walmart. If I was to come to town again, I would stay here.

 We had a last minute decision to stay overnight for a soccer tournament in Park City. This hotel was less than half the price of anything inside Park City and is only 25 miles away and is a really pretty drive through the canyon. We are so glad we stayed here! The room was clean, beds were very comfortable. Bathroom is small, but the cleanest and most up to date I've seen. Finally - no cracked caulking, peeling paper or rusty/dirty corners! Breakfast was great, a lot of variety. But the pool was the highlight for the kids. Its really big and was actually warm! I usually find myself hanging out in the hot tub because I cant stand cold water. But I never even got in the hot tub because I was having fun with my family in the nice warm water in the pool. Any time we find the need to stay in the Park City area, we will definitely drive the little extra and stay here!

 I was very pleased with the location of the hotel as well as the outside accommodations (pool, beach access), etc. The actual room was nice and clean as well, however I was very disappointed that there was no mirror outside of the bathroom sink area. Being that it was my birthday trip and I was getting dressed to go out every night, I hated not being able to see myself in a full-length mirror before I went out to hit the town. I was also disappointed that the bar closed at 8 p.m. so if you're looking for a party hotel, this is not the one for you! But you can walk to some others down the strip.

 staff was way out of their description to accommodate my family, even offered a group rate, when entire family arrived, even though no reservations were made, due to the nature of our visit to the city, to support our relatives their in time of bereavement. The breakfast was prepared hot and on time, and once again, the staff displayed no signs of stress and disgust... almost certain, that it was my best hotel experience ever received, even more so, than over the top hotels!

 Trip began with unprofessional staff stating room 's guest names in front of other guests. Maid cart in the way and when asked to move it-rec'd an eye roll and slow move of the cart. Room was NOT what was pictured on line. If we had more time to find another hotel WE WOULD HAVE!!! Room smelled musty and outdated. Empty beer bottle in the trash. Overhead lights did not work, there were hanging wires where the smoke detector should be. There were facial shaving remnants all over the back of the bathroom sink. The space below the door was about one inch tall. This was NOT the room I viewed pictures of on your website before booking. This was the first time that I booked a room through Expedia-not a pleasant stay. We were VERY disappointed. Again, if it wasn't late on a Friday afternoon after a long drive, we would have attempted to locate another hotel to stay in.

 I learned the morning after my stay when I went to use the bathroom shower and toilet that the town of Ithica was having water/sewage issues and that I shouldn't drink the water. I started the shower and while the water didn't look bad coming out of the faucet, as it puddled in the tub it was dirt brown. I called the front desk and was told about the problem. No one said anything when checking in to the hotel. This was beyond poor customer service.

 Overall, the room and hotel were very good. Unfortunately, the curtains do not close to block out parking lot lights and the attached bar/restaurant was quite loud on a Saturday night. Breakfast was good but the pool was very small and it shared a glass wall with the main hallway so that you felt like you were on display. Everything looked a bit updated and clean and the staff was pleasant. Be aware that they will ask for a CC for incidentals even if you are prepaid.

 We had a new room(only 3 months old) but the bathroom sink kept stopping up and they couldn't fix it. Maid service could have been better, not consistent or thorough. Food and drinks were great throughout, since we had all inclusive we used as much as we could. Wifi was included for 2 devices but we kept loosing signal and got charged international data by our mobile service. Could have had more activities at the pools, plus they charged us 5 each to play tennis even though we were on the all inclusive plan. We decided to take the time share presentation only because we got the right salesperson (Blanca) who ended up giving us 6 excursions instead of the resort credit after some negotiations we with her. The presentation was actually good and they didn't push us to hard to purchase.

A microwave was located at the end of the hallway, and the room offered a mini fridge which was sufficient for our needs. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The indoor pool was very nice.

 We stayed two nights. The room was a bit small, but very clean. We didn't go to stay in the room anyway. The t.v. was smaller than some as well and somewhat limited, and the internet was not so great in our corner, but we didn't go to stay in the room. There was a nice sized fridge, coffee maker, full-sized hair dryer and great shower head with great linens and grooming products. The Holiday Inn was conveniently just outside the Canyon and very close to Chinle. Native Guides are waiting in the Hotel if you want to go into the canyon. Guided trips vary from 3 hours to 6 hours, and the type of vehicle varies as well. My family went in a closed (vs. No windows, open-sided) Suburban which offered protection from the elements and a bit more comfort. Ask for Harold and his family. My family was impressed with H.'s knowledge of the canyon history, etc. He graciously answered many questions. We went into town for dinner even though the dinner special was steak for under 15. Our breakfast was very good with large portions. So one would expect the dinners to be likewise. The ladies in the gift shop were helpful and check-out was easy. We enjoyed our stay.

The air conditioning worked very well, which we were very happy about. We were disappointed that there were no dishes in the kitchenette, making it basically useless. We were also disappointed that the breakfast consisted of merely coffee, juice, muffins, and granola bars.

 My husband and I were visiting family in Dawsonville with our 6 week old baby and 1 and a half years old toddler. This hotel was very accommodating. They provided a crib for the baby, and our beds were very cozy queen size, so even without the crib all of us could sleep comfortable. The breakfast was awesome. The girl working at the front desk was such a delight. She was wonderful getting us checked in and getting us settled after our 12 hour drive from south Florida, and she helped me take care of some faxes and personal business. I can honestly say this hotel was perfect.

 Hotel was generally excellent. Sea view rooms looked great. Our room was on the side and had a terrible view of unsightly side of hotel next door. On reflection we should have asked to be moved but didn't bother as only there for a couple of days would definitely be worth paying more for the stunning view of port and cathedral. Had breakfast one day which was very good but quite expensive at 29 per person-would have been cheaper if we had included breakfast when we booked. Room facilities v good. Good wifi in room, lovely bed. Quite a long walk into town but very easy to hail a taxi if needed and not expensive at around 5. Would go back.

 I had high hopes for this hotel based on the price I was paying and the melia name plus the five star rating. I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything. No water in room on arrival and I was thirsty!!

 We didn't stay at the Blue Boar Inn, but were in the area and decided to have dinner. We made a reservation for 7 pm and showed up about 10 minutes early. A party of four walked in just before us and they were seated right away. The two of us, however, we asked to wait since we were a little bit early. It made us feel as if we weren't dressed well-enough or we didn't fit in, because the dining room was quite empty with only 4 tables there. I saw the waittress go upstairs with cutlery- had she sat us there, I would have just left. Instead, when we were seated, we opted for the terrace. The food is great. The portions are generous and the food is well-prepared. Definitely worth the price. Entrees range in the 20s.

 I booked this room thru Expedia. As Marriott normally does for such reservations, they provide you with a room at the stated rate but that room is, IMHO, the worst of the lot. In my case, I was assigned a wheelchair accessible room which meant that shelves and counterspace were slightly lower than normal. This made things more difficult for me since I stand nearly two meters in height and have a bad back. However, I decided I could tough it out given my late arrival and lack of desire to wander back to the front desk and request a change - which I would probably not be provided. Rather interestingly, I have booked rooms at five hotels in the past two weeks. Marriott was the only chain which provided a room of this sort. As for the hotel, it is quite large and the lobby is well lit. I was not aware of the Marriott Suites concept and was pleased with the size and comfort of the room. However, in the process of checking in and checking out, I found the staff to be both efficient but not that friendly. I also did not appreciate the housekeeping staff banging on my room door at 8:00 in the morning. When I did not answer, the staff proceeded to force her way into the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged. Shame on me for not placing the do not disturb sign out prior to my shower. Thankfully, parking was free but internet was not. Another disappointment. There are lots of hotels in the vicinity. I'll try another on my next trip

 not a hotel but condos being rented out by a management company...room was dirty and dilapidated.. refrigerator did not work.... wifi was weak and sporadic...bedroom a/c sounded like an airplane landing and living room a/c did not blow cold...got lots of hidden charges...was charged extra for using the boat ramp to put my boat in the water and then got charged an additional 55.00 per day to keep the boat in the water behind the condo....felt like I got scammed...could have stayed at a real resort for what I ended up paying with all the extra fees...run down property and with the exception of the front desk clerk the staff was rude.

 We went to Miami for Blackfriday shopping. We were a goup of five friends and decided to book a two bedroom suite. The suite was very nice and clean with a king size bed in the first room and a queen in the second. The living room had a sofa bed with a thin but firm mattress (something difficult to find in any other hotel). The kitchen was well supplied although some glasses were missing and there was no liquid soap to handwash the dishes. Breakfast was good with eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, fruit, cereals, etc. The beds were awesome. This is the first time I really sleep in a hotel bed because I usually wake up with my back hurting or my neck twisted, but not this time! The room was big enough for the five of us and all our shopping bags plus 10 big suitcases! I didn't hear a sound all night long (and the hotel was all booked). The location of the hotel is excellent. Real close to Sawgrass Mills and very convenient when going to the Dolphin Mall or Miami Downtown (40 minute drive).

 The stay was overall good. The air condition in the rooms are motion-controlled or something. No matter where you set the thermostat. It never gets any colder. They were going to send somebody after maintenance to look at it. But it was 3 in the morning when we went to bed. Didn't want somebody in my room that late. The casino needs new chairs the ones they have are very uncomfortable. Trying to sit at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do. The bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get up and go to the bathroom from a table. Since the tables are in the middle of the casino. Poor design for bathrooms. But drinks were great my drink was never empty playing on the tables or at the slot machines. Which is extremely nice. Everybody was very friendly for the most part. I will stay again.

 We checked in late (about 11pm) and I had called ahead of time to make sure that there would be someone at the front desk. When we got there, there was no one at the front desk, we had to wait around for them. Then, their computer went down and they could not check me in. They resorted to using a paper check in so that I could at least get in my room. This was a bit frustrating. When we got to our room, there was only ONE Queen. I ordered Two Queens. I had to go back to the front desk and complain. I had 3 children with me that were cranky and tired. After dragging all the kids back to the front desk, we noticed that there was a old musky scent that encompassed the entire hotel. The kids complained that it was an old man smell. They gave us a new room with Two Queens and I was able to get situated. The breakfast was crappy. Their biscuits and gravy tasted like left overs and their coffee came from an automated vending machine. I couldn't drink it. It was bitter and tasted nasty. Overall, we did not have a good experience.

 I wish all my hotels I stayed at was as great as the Red Roof in Troy,MO. The pros: 1.Indoor, heated pool 2. Over a hundred premium movie channels(Hbo,showtime,etc). I counted them all 3. Huge rooms. 4. Great shower pressure and very large bathrooms. 5. The price The only bad thing I could say was the mattress was kind of old. Could feel the spring in mattress a little bit, like in an older firm mattress. But I think they in end of making a renovation on the place but nothing bothersome at all.

 I've been to Nola a few times before and I haven't met a staff of hotel that I've loved better! The Staff was so welcoming to my group and always their to lend a hand when needing new door keys at 3am! Its wasn't very crowded at all so it was nice to be able to come and relax after a long day/night. The court yard with the pool is adorable and so refreshing! The room was great with ice cold air!! Our stay was perfect and we will def come back to stay here Again.

 We were pretty disappointed in the comfort of the sofa sleeper. It was by far the most uncomfortable and lumpy thing I've even had to sleep on. I originally booked 2 queens and received a call the day before to see if we were willing to switch to a King size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house. She kept emphasizing that the room is slightly larger since we have 2 adults and 1 child. So we agreed. WORST DECISION EVER. The queen pull out was not only lumpy and slanted, but even our 3 year old said she was NOT sleeping on it! Obviously they've never slept on their own pull out because if they did, then it would've been thrown again 10 years ago!

 We stayed in the Sun Room, which is a little on the small side but space is efficiently used and completely charming. The deck was a wonderful place to relax and have breakfast in the morning, and makes the size of the room irrelevant. The staff is one of the most delightful and gracious I've experienced at an inn. I hope to have many opportunities to return.

 The hotel was ok to stay just had minor things wrong such as the microwave was not something I would use to warm my food in and I had two bugs in the room which was creepy because I'm scared of bugs and also I'm a germaphobic so the toilet wasn't the worse just could have been cleaned better but all around I rate my stay a 3.

 Careful when booking! My Fiance and I hosted our engagement party at this venue. We we're very excited and reserved half of the venue for 3 hours of drinks and appetizers for family and friends. We are very disappointed with the service that we got from the event coordinator. During the booking process and contract stage she messed up sending me the wrong party information (BEO) and date several times. The night started and there was a miscommunication with the coordinator and the bar staff. For half the event our guests we told they could not order certain drinks from the bar that we had paid for! This was very embarrassing to us knowing that our 60+ guests we're told they could only order bud and bud lt when we had specifically talked about offering all draft beer + bud and bud lt. Secondly we were told we would have our own bartender to take care of our group seeing as there were 60 people at the event. We only saw 2 bartenders behind the bar 3 times that night. Most of the time there was only 1 bartender for the whole bar and had several people mention how long it took to get a drink. Long story short it is a pretty venue but you do not want to host an event here. The service is absolutely horrible. Even after the event when I brought up the issues I figured they would help us out with a discount or gift card and all they offered us was a buy 1 get 1 free coupon to brunch!

 The weekend we stayed experienced warmer than usual tempertures.  We turned the heat off and it was still too hot in the room.   I guess the air was turned off for the season.  We didn't ask the staff for assistance because we were just too tired to deal with it after spending the day at a family wedding. Luckily, we were able to open the windows and it was much better.  Aside for this issue, the hotel is great, the service is great and the location is fabulous!   I would stay there again on my next visit to VA.

 First room checked into the room smelled of dog and urine so bad that my throat stared to close off and I couldn't breath. I went down to the front desk and they were giving some difficulty because I made the reservation on. We hen I told them I had allergies and can't stay in that room is when they gave me another room. That rooms beds are like sleeping in conceret and the sheet have holes in them so you can see the matteress. The towels have holes in them and are so rough they feel like sandpaper. I booked this hotel because I had a pool and said limited pets. Well the pool is broken too. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm here because a family had an accident and is in the hospital I would not stay here. Since it's also a holiday weekend rooms are limited. I can say NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY HERE!

I didn't even stay, I decided to leave as soon as I lifted the covers from the bed and roaches were all over dead and alive. Too bad, the staff was friendly and the price was cheap, but not worth staying for.

 This was the worst hotel experience ever! We checked in got into our room and that was the first part of the nightmare. Peeling wallpaper and mold in the bathroom. Stained carpets in the bedroom. The pool had a layer of scum coating the surface and the gym equipment was non functional. To top it off the entire hotel had a lingering diesel odor. BEWARE before you book here.

 Loved the hotel and staff. Great setting. We decided to just stay there for a swim and dinner and breakfast the next morning. It's the kind of hotel that has robes for guests (plus two different styles of slippers!). Nice soaps. Beautiful setting. A little close to the road so you do get some road noise. And the gym is pretty stripped down. But a great place for a day or two or relaxation!

The front desk clerk was very apologetic and immediately changed the sheets for us. There is a nice breakfast restaurant within walking distance. The front desk clerk had to check people in, clean rooms, and take care of customer issues. They need more staff.

Our room was discusting. I thought since it was a Wydham brand it couldn't be that bad even though the rate was very reasonable. I slept in my clothes. There was black mold growing in the bathroom. We left by 6:30 am, when I asked for a receipt the same guy who checked us in refused to give me one.

 My wife and I stayed overnight for a concert in Saratoga Springs. We weren't sure what to expect as we have never stayed in a Super 8 hotel before, but we were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is easy to find from the thruway and the exterior looks modern and well tended. There are plenty of gas stations and restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but it never seemed overly loud. The inside of the hotel is equally nice, very clean and either new or recently updated. Front desk staff will very friendly and efficient. Our room was a queen bed, non-smoking. The room was small but very bright and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. We went to the free breakfast in the morning and it was simple but well stocked- bagels, toast, waffles, yogurt, etc. We had a very pleasant and hassle-free stay and I would definitely stay there again.

 Staff were rude when we asked for more towels for our room. The continental breakfast was donuts, toast, apples or Cheerios. The AC in the room could barely keep the room comfortable running on high and the room has a funky smell probably from the food that was under the beds. General appearance of the hotel is pretty run down. Location is great, easy to find right off the interstate but that is the only good thing about the hotel.

 Strong odd smell in room. AC/Heat window unit is 12 inches from bed. Toilet rocked. Shower water control falling apart. Shower head very low and was not refitted to accomodate the sloppy reno of granite slab shower walls. Towels are rough like a loofa. Breakfast: barely luke warm coffee. Powdered eggs-not kidding. lousy biscuits. I gave up on eating there. Worker loudly chatting on phone and sitting at table whole time I was there. Never even looked up. On the plus side-bed was comfortable. I wish this review was an exaggeration. It's not. Waste of a free night reward.

 I visit Bellefonte once or twice yearly to see family and friends. This is a convenient location to both Bellefonte and State College. Initially I stayed at this hotel because nothing else was vacant - but over the past several years under current management, hotel has become better maintained and upgrades and improvements have been made. Good service and friendly staff.

 I didn't have any issues with the staff-- in fact the morning crew was fantastic! The only bad experience I had was at check in. I know it was a general manager checking us in, I believe her name was Penny, but she was extremely rude and condescending when she spoke to me and the rest of my party. There was a mistake with the booking on my end, but she did not handle the situation professionally at all. instead she spoke down to us like we were trying to trick her or something. The room was decent and the breakfast was good, as well as the gentleman working the breakfast rush!

 My children gave me the gift over Thanksgiving of staying at Hotel Monaco, which was lovely . . .with one exception. The staff was excellent: as I am partially disabled, I require certain types of rooms and the hotel accommodated promptly. The room was comfortable and the location of the hotel -- near the center of charming Old Town Alexandria -- could not be better. However, my family and I were disturbed by a race-baiting plaque on the hotel exterior, which we thought very inappropriate for a hotel of the quality of the Monaco. When brought to the attention of the hotel staff, they seemed not to know the history of the plaque.

She sent us to a nice little diner and it was well worth it. Great food. Check out was good to. It was just to small for 4 people. Breakfast was good. Your friends from Maine

 This was by far the worst hotel that we have stayed at. Even called the front desk last night to get a late checkout from 11am to 1pm and he said the best I can do is 12pm bye and hung up on me. This was after we had them switch our room as it was dirty and had a small comforter on a king size bed with no blankets. All though they did upgrade us yes with a charge of course, the new room had three throw pillows on the bed. No pillows other than the three throw pillows. Do not waste your time here. Also couldn't utilize the hot tub or pool area as none of the doors are restricted with key entry only the whole neighborhood was in there and they ordered food to be delivered. THEY WERE NOT PAYING GUESTS!!!

 This hotel is one that allows pets. We were not sure what we would find when we checked in. When you are traveling on a budget with a pet sometimes the accommodations can be way overpriced and very disappointing. Some places charge a ridiculous rate for pets and are not really that pet friendly. The pet fee at this hotel was only 25. Though the hotel was older (and a bit worn) it was clean and the staff extremely friendly and kind to our little Bella. She had a fine time going out for her walks, the area was safe to walk her (even at night) and away from traffic and she was always greeted with a Hello Bella from the staff when she returned. It was disappointing that the new ice maker had not yet been delivered (installation was over due - not the hotels fault certainly) and the staff apologized for the lack of an ice maker. Luckily the weather was not extremely hot. A small refrigerator in the room would have been nice. Belgin waffle at breakfast was quite good, much better than expected for a do-it-yourself waffle. This place was convenient to highway exit, gas stations, restaurants and stores nearby, least expensive price in the area after summer season rates started. It was clean, very safe, very quiet and we felt welcome. We would stay here again.

 Great Service! Thank you! The guest rooms are in a separate section of the house and they keep Barney in the main house. There are no mini-fridges in the room, but John was happy to provide us with ample ice and a bucket to chill our wine. He also offered us a space in their fridge if we needed to store anything else. The rooms all have DVD players and they have movies there you can borrow. They also provided us with fluffy white terrycloth robes and aromatherapy beads for the jacuzzi. The gas fireplace was also very nice. It was too cold to swim (May 3-6) but the pool looked great and I was sad I didn't get to try it out. Our stay was delightful and I recommend it highly for singles or couples who just need a break from it all!

 Your staff was wonderful. John, Nicki, Jennifer. I can't recall her name she was the cook in the kitchen. She ran the entire kitchen short blonde hair mid fifties. The reason why I go to such trouble describing her was that she was absolutely superb. Very professional food presentation. Clean, and she was a exceptionally nice person to talk to.

 I am a foreman for a construction company that does finish work with solid surface and stone. Upon arrival, I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff. The outside of the building and grounds were beautiful and inviting. I was quickly deflated when I saw my room. The room was extremely outdated. The room smelled old and musty. My first impression was that I was staying in an old smelly hospice facilty. The first thing I like to do after a long day of work is sit down and watch some tv to decompress. The tv was an old brick style, the picture was so dark I couldn't see what was on screen unless the lights were off in the room. The tv had no possible adjustments within the menu to make the picture more visible . The bed, I could feel the springs poking my back. In the morning, I could hardly move from the pain caused by the bed. The countertops were an old Formica top that that had been painted multiple times. I was excited that wifi was included but however was slow and we lost connection multiple times while trying to watch an exciting game that I was waiting for The worst part, there was a wall repair done in the bathroom, that was unfinished. The dust and crumbs of the repair were in every corner of the bathroom. There was no paint on the freshly applied texture. The price was overpriced for the quality of the room. I pay less money for better accommodations nearby. I would love to have an alternative to the competition. I would return if there were improvements.

 Hotel was good. Friendly service and the room wasn't bad, but had minimal flaws. Found a couple bugs in the room, nothing horrible. Had a faint smell to it, and a few of the outlets didnt work. Overall stay was good though. Hotel had a full bar, and a resteraunt. Only thing i didnt like, and i know all hotels are like this but this one seemed like it was worse, was that you can hear everything outside the room. People kept walking by the room threw the night talking and can hear everything they were talking about.

 We atayed at the hotel from 7/3-7/6. The room was old, smelly, bathtub was broken, toilet seat was burned and the water presure was incosistent. Carpet was old and dirty. Room service came one time and just made our beds with all that was in our bed such as cheerios and baby's toys. They did not change our towels or clean the bathroom. Water in the pool was cold. Lot of noise around the pool did not make our stay relaxing. They charged 220 per night. It is such a shame to rip off hard working American people just bc they wanted to celebrate their most important holiday July 4th. This room is not worth 30. Would not recomend this hotel to anyone.

 I decided to stay at this Comfort Inn based on the reviews I read. I will never stay at another Comfort Inn based on my experience. I knew that I would be getting to the hotel late so I notated this when I booked the room and called to confirm that this would not be an issue. I arrived to find out that the reservation had been cancelled as I was listed as a No Show. The individual at the Front Desk was having trouble locating a room and 1 hour later, I was informed a room had been reserved under the same request - No Smoking and two double beds. After finally getting to the room, it reeked of cigarette smoke and the bedding was stained. I took a picture to provide to the hotel staff who cared less when I addressed this. Based on this, needless to say, I will not recommend this hotel or ever think of staying at another Comfort Inn again.

 Me and the Mrs stayed at the hotel for a few nights as our mini honeymoon getaway to Atlantic City. The Pros: The Hotel room we chose had an in room jacuzzi. It definitely added to the experience. The king size bed was comfortable making for a good night's rest. Our room was outfitted with a microwave, mini fridge and cable tv. The hotel front desk attendant was friendly as was the house keeper. While not directly on the beach, its a relatively short trip to the beach/casinos. The NJ transit system has buses that pass through the area hourly, if you dont happen to drive. Cons:While there is a beverage vending machine and ice machine on site, you would have to go elsewhere for food. Denny's is about a 5min walk from the hotel and you could always order in. All in all a Good stay considering the price.

 So cozy and charming! Everyone was extremely nice and helpful (they even gave us an extra can of bear spray that other hikers had left behind), and I couldn't have asked for more. On the grounds are a mini golf course, a frisbee golf basket, and a lounge area. The motel rooms are quaint and country-style. My friends and I loved it! If you want to have more of a rustic experience, they have mini cabins, tipis, and an RV lot (with laundry facilities) as well. Will absolutely stay here again!

 Das Hotel liegt zwischen der A44 (Krefeld Fichtenhain) und einem Industriegebiet. Wir haben hier nach einer Feier bernachtet und dementsprechend nicht viel Zeit in dem Hotel verbracht. Zimmer: moderne, zweckmige Einrichtung, ingesamt sauber und ordentlich. Das Frhstcksbffet war lecker - wir haben hier nichts vermisst. Unser Zimmer war in Richtung des gepflasterten Parkplatzes gelegen. Leider drangen Stimmen und anderer Lrm (geklapper von gezogenen Koffern etc) in die offensichtlich sehr hellhrigen Zimmer und sorgten dafr, dass man frh wach wurde. Deswegen gibt es einen Punkt Abzug beim Zimmerkomfort.

 best in the wine country My wife and I travel extensively and I can honestly say this property easily ranks up with the best we have ever stayed at. The quality and sophistication of the rooms and deacutecor, the service and ultra attentive staff was a 10+. The premium rooms are pricy, however our experience is that the other comparable hotels were more expensive (600+) and not as refined. Our friends we traveled with felt the same and we plan to visit again next year.

 Awful condition! Old decor with stained walls. Tub was stained with rust. Breakfast was cereal or you could use their waffle maker. Had to pay 188 for the night because everywhere else in town was sold out. When we pulled in to the parking lot, we saw two men sitting behind the building smoking. One had a house arrest ankle tether! Building obviously used to allow smoking. To its credit, at least the lobby and hallways had a strong odor of cleaning supplies.

Worse yet, the gentleman wanted to have ME arrested for breaking and entering with MY KEY!! Thankfully he did not have a weapon so I was not shot! All my things were gone from the room and it had been assigned to the couple. Thankfully, they gave me another room but I DID have to pay for it I still haven't been compensated for my missing items.

 My company HQ having moved to Crystal City from DC provided me with an excellent opportunity to get away from the usual Georgetown or Dupont Circle haunts and I was very glad I did.The Hotel Monaco (there's a sister hotel in DC near the Mall) was quirky but comfortable and the room, while a little small by normal US standards, was unusually designed, well appointed and extremely comfortable, with free, fast WiFi for the workers among us. The staff were all helpful without being gushing and the hotel was well positioned for the excellent restaurants of Old Town Alexandria. If you're a dog lover this is a great place to be - they have doggie happy hours twice a week when our canine chums can bring their owners along for a pre-dinner drink. Old Town Alexandria itself is a friendly place just a few stops on the Metro from National Airport and onwards to DC. Lots of shops and restaurants and very pleasant just for a stroll around - a welcome relaxation after a busy working day, you could almost be home.

 The hotel is somewhat run down, could have been renovated years ago bot we keep going back there because of it's location and the 5 star gardens. it's directly opp. the beach and quality restaurants are within close proximity. You can tip the cleaning staff all you like but they will still forget shampoo and extra toilet paper. A big plus are the breakfast which carters to a lot but somehow manage to be well organised and the food is of a high standard. Pools are well maintained and lounges are positioned in both sunlight and under tree shaded areas. I will return there because I know what to expect.

There were outlets on the lamp on the desk on other side of the room, but had to utilize them for other (work) devices. Room was spacious, more spacious than other Holiday Inn's and was clean comfortable. Only had time for breakfast once (here working) and only had the scrambled eggs. Taste and consistency was fine.

My only complaint was that there were smoking rooms on my floor and could smell it when I walked into the hallway.

 Our stay was terrible. The room was dirty, sheets had stains on them, bathroom was dirty, only had 2 small towels to bath with, one very small bar of soap, and room smelled strongly of smoke but was suppose to be a non smoking room. It was by far not worth what we were charged for it. We will not stay there again.

 I figured it would be tough to get a good night's sleep so close to the highway, but it was unbelievably quiet. Whatever they've done to make it soundproof, it worked!

 Very unhappy. It started with the games regarding the fact that they wanted more money than what was prepaid. I had to pay it but it felt like extortion as it was late at night. To make matters worse, the pillows were TERRIBLE. Overall a terrible night of rest. I could not even occupy myself as the night went on as they could not get the WIFI to work. We wanted to give the local hotel a try as our son just started at the local college but I think we will need to look towards staying in Lincoln as they obviously did not care about the business.

 I should have known the rooms would have been DISGUSTING by the smell of the lobby!! Serious mold and mildew smell... lobby employee was bickering on the phone with who I guessed to be a displeased customer..so we had to wait to check in and heard the whole conversation. The room was less than adequate.. in fact we stayed less than 3 hours! The shower was disgusting!! Cobwebs throughout the room and bathroom.. toilet didnt flush! No water pressure! The bedding and walls had stains all over them!!! Had they not had my credit card on file I would have requested my back but was fearful they would charge expenses to my card illegally!!! TERRIBLE HOTEL!!

 I booked through this third-party site, paid extra for a room with a balcony & made a notation in the "notes" section that we'd like a roll-away bed for a child if it was available (the website said they were available on a first-come basis). When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me & I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the "miscommunication", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website.

The breakfast was good, but I've had better. Limited food choices but the staff kept up with those items that needed replenishment. Overall my experience was good and I would stay at this facility again. Its just not as nice as some other La Quinta Inns in which I've stayed.

 We drove all day and needed a room for the night. I was able to book the room online en route and snagged a great discount. Despite major road construction at the exit off the parkway, we were able to find the hotel fine. The front desk attendant was very helpful in suggesting a restaurant that would deliver at the late hour we had arrived. He also showed us where the breakfast kitchen set up was but he didn't mention the amazing selection of food we had to choose from! Our room was very comfortable in size. The beds were very comfortable with soft and luxurious bedding! The bathroom was spa like! The adjustable massaging shower head was perfect to end the long day of driving! I hated to leave! If all LaQuintas are as nice as this one in Hopkinsville, I will never book anywhere else!

 The staff was incredibly nice and accomodating however, the hotel was less than pleasant. Only two of the lights worked, there were no trashcans, there was trash underneath of the bed, the bathroom was disgusting, there was a layer of what I'm hoping was just dust covering the entire ceiling, the door did not shut all of the way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience. The staff was great, like I said, and gave me no issues when I checked out early/cancelled the rest of my reservation. I would never stay here again or reccommend to a friend. The photos online were WAY better than the actual hotel itself.

 We stayed in this pet friendly motel for several days because we were in town for a dog show. The staff was polite and the location was good. The room was clean with comfortable beds and great air conditioning. However, the room was quite small. So small in fact that I needed to leave my suitcase in the car as we had run out of room. Housekeeping also failed to clean our room one day - they came in and got the dirty towels off of the floor, but never replaced them with clean ones, make the beds, or empty the trash. The other thing that we found disappointing was having no trash receptacles on the property. As responsible pet owners who clean up after our dogs, there was no place to dispose of it, so we had to use the dumpster located at the neighboring bank parking lot. During the week there were many construction companies staying here who dominated the common area with cookouts and parties. I was glad that our room did not face the picnic (party) area.

 The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.

 Just returned from a week at the Hotel Elba Sara with my 16 year old daughter, very happy with the hotel, very clean and food was great, wide variety. One little thing we were disappointed with, was our flight was an evening departure and while we understood that the hotel was busy and late check out was but possible but no courtesy room was available even for an hour to shower etc, we ended up showering in the gym and trying to pack out last bits into the suitcase on the foyer floor, not ideal, give the calibre of the hotel this just let it down Hotel is located a bit outside the resort, nothing much in the vicinity, shops bars etc about 15 mins walk or 3,50euro in a taxi.

 I was very disappointed when I saw that my room had roaches. They eventually switched me to a deluxe room which was the same room but in front of the pool. That room had a stuffed up shower and the curtains were falling off the window. There were lemon slices under my bed and next to the TV. They eventually got someone to uclog the shower but the experience was not good. It was a smoke free room but you could smell cigarettes from the staff walking around smoking all the time. The hotel was cheap and close to the beach but not worth the hassle. I would not recommend anyone to stay here.

 Pros: - Nice breakfast (but overpriced) - Sea view - Room decoration Cons: - Wifi connection dropped every second minute randomly, reconnection sometimes possible, sometimes not. We asked the staff on three occasions to fix it (and showed them on our device that we don't make it up because they claimed it worked). When we left they claimed that an IT guy fixed it but they never asked us before whether it worked for us. The least we would expect in a FIVE star hotel. - we had to pay about 100 USD for roaming fees instead (as we had to work). We were not offered a discount or anything. - Breakfast EUR 30 per person, some cutlery not clean - Shower head broken (but fixed on the next they when we told it to the staff) - Gym oldish, one thread mill not working. Spider webs in corners - Hotel is located above a busy street (separating hotel from beach). In our room with sea view, we couldn't leave the windows open and balcony was just for decoration but not really for use The above critics sounds harsh, but we expected definitely more of an expensive five star hotel.

Would not suggest this location. Pay the extra money for a real place. Like the ones 20 miles up the road or even the ones just off the interstate.

 The hotel is old. We got in late but I needed to shower and the tub was SUPER loud. Every time I moved around, it cracked and creaked. Not to mention that the shower head was sticking out of a big hole on the wall. It was fine for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice hotel. Although, for the price, I guess I can't really complain. The neighborhood was okay. I don't think there was much to do around but we were just there to sleep and hit the road.

 I loved it here. It was exactly what we wanted at the right price. An easy walk to everywhere, a beautiful old building, it was just easy. Location was perfect for us. We liked it so much that after arriving at the airport and finding our flight was cancelled I immediately rebooked the Lamothe Hotel and dinner reservations at Peche (in that order). Rating is on my satisfaction - I'm giving this 5 stars because it was a great stay but this isn't a 5 star hotel. We stayed in Room 115 which is too close to the back gate and louder than the other rooms but that doesn't affect how much we enjoyed ourselves.

 The room was acceptable. It was very small with no place to sit besides the on the bed, which was less than one foot from the window on one side, (had to climb in to bed from the foot). There was a fridge and coffee maker and micro wave. TV was fine. But it was not a room to spend much time in beside sleeping. It is 15 miles of high speed road to West Glacier, which was good, but I wish we would have looked for some place closer. Over all it seemed a little high priced for the amenities you received. Again, it was acceptable. Only three stars at that price (146 expedia). The staff was great. We decided to go home one day early and they graciously allowed us to cancel the final night.

When we arrived quite late on a friday evening, they had overbooked and our room was no longer available. They had already printed out directions for us to get to a nearby Hampton, and paid the difference so we could stay there. It was a very pleasant experience, and we were impressed with how they handled the situation.

 Mini vacation with the girlfriend. She needed a chance to relax from work, and this room was definitely very relaxing. The bed was super comfortable, the room was very large and non-constricting. The bathroom was a little small, but usable. there was plenty of sitting space, a large dresser and desk for storage, as well as about 5 feet of wall shelves to hang clothing and towels to dry. This would be the perfect place for an extended stay. We did however see mold in the bathroom, which was a bit disconcerting.

 We had some issue checking in after booking through Hotels.com. After about 10 minutes and showing the clerk our confirmation, they were able to confirm and show us as registered guests. The hotel clerk staff seemed to indicate and issue with Hotels.com bookings. After that issue, all was well. Our room was very nice and the hotel was clean and looked well kept. The slopes were just right outside the L2 terrace, and the staff was very friendly. The hotel does charge a 15/day parking fee, but the valet service was very good, and provided our vehicle very quickly. Many of the lounges and bars have entertainment from 3pm until 11pm. The food was good, but a little more expensive than you would typically expect - what else would you expect from a resort, though All in all, it was a very good experience.

 This hotel was full of contradictions. At first sight it looked dingy, the elevator has to be a hundred years old, the carpet on the hallways and in the rooms is thick and generally not too appealing to the eye. However, the beds are the comfiest beds that I've slept in in awhile. There's a good size flat screen tv in the room and a keurig coffee maker!! All in all a good value for your money especially in that part of the country where even a motel 6 can be quite pricey. Reserve judgement until after you check out

 We stayed at the Monaco from 7/5/11 - 7/7/11 and were really pleased. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels and had not-so-great experiences ... this one was a breath of fresh air.From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, everyone was always smiling, pleasant and very helpful. We were checked in very quickly and our room (two double beds) was big, very clean and smelled nice. The bathroom was so sparkling clean that my son (who is very picky) couldn't wait to take a bath (FYI, we are generally shower people.) Yes, the a/c unit can be loud, but when you're tired from a day of sightseeing and full from a big dinner ... all I can say is that I slept very well. I personally would have preferred a firmer mattress but that is really the only complaint I can make. When I realized that I had left my toothbrush and showercap at home, I called the front desk and housekeeping was at my door in 5 minutes with complimentary toiletries. As for Wi-Fi, just sign up on their website to join their club (no charge) and you will get your internet for free. I even read that you can get coupons for some free mini-bar use.My brother and his wife were on the trip with us and their room, with a king bed, was smaller than ours. Being from Europe, they are not fans of a/c to begin with and the loud noise theirs was making made it hard for them to sleep. They finally called guest services to complain because they couldn't turn if off either and were immediately moved to another room (just to sleep in) for the night. The next day while we were out, they had an engineer come in and fix the unit. By the time we came back, it was working fine and there was a bottle of wine waiting for them for their troubles.I did like the decor of the lobby ... colorful and eclectic but in a nice way. The location itself was great because it was so close to great shops and restaurants. There is a french cafe next door which was great for breakfast. We tried dinner at the restaurant downstairs ... although my dinner was good (bucket of fried chicken), my brother felt that the ribs and BBQ chicken were a bit dry. Overall, not worth the money we spent. The wait staff, however, was very efficient and friendly.The next night we tried an Italian restaurant up the street ... Bartucci's. This place was great! Their pastas were homemade and the seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. Great wine selection also. This place was worth it and we will definitely go back next time we are in town.Overall, I found our stay very satisfying and reasonably priced. Checkout was quick and they even e-mailed me my bill. Based on my experience, I would definitely go back and I would recommend this place without hesitation!

 We loved everything about our stay here. The guest room was nicely appointed and very clean. But the best thing about our stay was the incredibly comfortable mattress. We had the best sleep that we've ever had away from home. When traveling in the future, we will try to find a Best Western in the area.

 I was really put off with Booking.com! I tried to contact them to find out why my reservation didn't show up but I couldn't get through when I called. It was extremely frustrating! The room was fantastic! It was clean and looked new. The bed was super comfortable! The pantry was well stocked but they didn't have razors for sale. I wish the hotel had a breakfast available and a pool or spa.

 We thought the hotel was a little tired looking. Drawer handles on the dresser were loose, things like that. The breakfast was the same every day would have liked a little more variety. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The maid service was not very thorough at times, i.e. pulling the sheet up and tucking it in without making sure the mattress pad was in place.

 Every time I come to New York I always stay at the Marriott Marquis Time Square. The hotel is located in a great part of the city (TIME SQUARE) and is near all the local attractions. Even though you are in the heart of the city you never hear the hustle and bustle from your room, which is very nice. The rooms are spacious and checking in is always fast and efficient. The rates may change depending on the time of year you visit, but it is well worth the extra money you had planned on spending. Great place, great location, great rooms, what more could you ask for?!!!!

 The desk staff were rude and acted like they didn't have the time of day for any of our questions or requests. The breakfast bar had great bagels but not much else. I mean, who ever heard of putting Swiss cake rolls out for breakfast? Pool was closed for repairs which was one of the main reasons we had chosen it but no mention of the upcoming repairs was mentioned when I called to inquire about it. Howard Johnson's used to represent quality when I was a kid but this one gives the company a bad name.

 My wife and I were in town for a wedding and running late to rehearsal. The check in was quick so, we were able to drop off our things and go. When we returned we got the full scope of where we were. It's a very shady area so the local element did not look welcoming. Our room didn't look clean in the bathroom. Some of the towels had marks on them that made us think they shouldn't be used anymore. The hotel guide in the room was not helpful at all. The tv guide in the room guide was completely wrong. The wifi is terrible, couldn't even send an email or watch netflix. However, the bed was comfy and clean and we got a good night's sleep over all.

 Very friendly staff who were helpful. Clean, well organized hotel. The room had fairly old carpet, with a few stains, but didn't feel dirty - just old. Otherwise the room was well kept, sheets were very clean. The hotel in general was well maintained and clean. The free breakfast was good and the WiFi signal was strong and data came through quickly. The TV had a few basic channels, standard HBO was Spanish only, but that was fine. The pool is clean and centrally located. I loved that it offered free stay for our dog, but there is almost zero places to walk your dog so they may do their business. The only places were a few gravel medians and side areas, but it worked out okay. The location isn't great - not much to walk to directly next to the hotel, but a 8 minute drive does get you to Reid Park. Traffic was terrible in the area though, which made leaving the hotel to the south very difficult. I would stay here again.

 We originally planned on booking the Riu for my bachelorette party but they were fully booked so we settled on this hotel. Check-in was great, Sergio upgraded the two double bed suites we had booked to a presidential suite. The suite had two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a kitchen, dining, and living area. Best of all it came with a jacuzzi with an oceanview patio. It was perfect for me and my girls! The food was really good compared to what I've had at the Riu. The staff was super friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the hotel is so big that you have to take a golf cart everywhere, whether it's to go eat or swimming at the pool.

 Overall we were pleased with our stay. The only downfall was that we had asked to be notified once our room was ready we had arrived about an hour before check in. When we contacted hotel staff around 45 minutes after allowed check in time we were told our room had been ready. Very frustrating on a cold rainy day when we just wanted to get settled.

Hotel was pretty dated but was under remodel. I was lucky to have a nicely remodeled room and again....wonderful bed and pillows!

 We showed up late and the place had a cool neon old school feel to it. But once out of the car we found a lot of rif raft around the area. They appear to have been patrons but I'm not sure if it was just the ours we were awake or what. But once in room, it was ok, older but clean. only there for about 4hrs then back on the road. Probably would not stay here again. Stayed many other places around it and all others have been better

 Hotel was good. Very close to public transportation (1 block away) MARTA train and buses. Service was good, accommodations good. Pool Exercise room was fine. Front desk and housekeeping was good. Free breakfast was excellent, and the woman that cooked the food was tremendous. I came down to exercise when breakfast was ending. She offered to cook me some eggs. HOWEVER, there was one employee, a woman at front desk when I checked in that was unprofessional and rude. I asked her what was the charges amount, she said she didn't know, because I booked thru third party. I get auto notification on my card thru my phone, and saw that it didn't match. I immediately went to question it, and she gave me attitude. I told her that she should have mentioned that they take a little extra for incidentals. THAT wasn't a problem, BUT, she should have mentioned that when I checked in AND asked about what amount is being taken off the card. When I called after my stay, I got her on phone, and inquired to ensure that the money was being put back on my card,,,she started explaining how long it might take to show on my card. I said I'm not asking how long, I want to ensure that it was simply put back. SHE SHOULD'NT be allowed people, her posture and unprofessionalism is horrendous

 In town for a family event, grandson's graduation from boot camp. Room was large, clean and ready upon arrival. AC was set at freezing. I realize this is an extended stay motel and we only stayed two nights but there were 6 of us and two very small bottles of shampoo and conditioner, two small bars of soap. Really Convenient location, was a ways from the event but closer motels were already full. We decided to stay an extra night but the front desk said they were full. Went online and several rooms were available online for this motel. Train you front desk people. They lost a room sale because we ended up booking at a motel very close by for lots less.

 Close to the waterfront, but still only a 15 minute walk to the Metro, Hotel Monaco is well situated for exploring Alexandria and DC. Our rooms on the 6th floor weren't large, but were well appointed and decorated, with a large well-stocked bathroom. We were on the quiet back of the hotel, although we could slightly hear weddings taking place in the courtyard below. a second upholstered chair (there was one plus a desk chair), would have been nice. The room was quite clean. Service was helpful and unobtrusive. You can save on parking if you park under the building across the street to the north instead of using the valet.

 The best thing about the hotel is the location. The room was clean but bathroom is in great need of refurbishing. The walls had black marks on them and need either a really good cleaning or fresh coat of paint. The shower tiles have been painted and the paint is peeling on the windowsill so you could see the original color. The staff was very friendly and it is an old hotel but okay if you just need a place to sleep and shower.

 Lack of communication was a huge problem with this venue. I initially began the planning process with one wonderfully professional catering manager. She was fired from this venue and I was never informed of this. The successive catering manager was NOT responsive, did not return my calls in a timely manner, and was extremely arrogant. We had problems with our room reservations, late check out communication and a not much was done to accommodate the challenges that we experienced. We spent more than $31,000.00 and were very displeased with The Garden of the Gods Club. We even endured disrespectful comments from club members concerning wedding party members. Their claim to fame is the beautiful background setting...The Garden of the Gods...I was extremely disappointed with their service.

 Parking is not great but it was easy enough to park on the street in the evening and as long as you move your car before 8:00 a.m., there is no charge after 6:00 p.m. That worked for us, but if we wanted to sleep in, it would have been a problem. Valet service is available but it was 24 for overnight parking. The front desk clerk that greeted us was not very friendly, but not rude either. It may have just been the end of a long day. The hotel is very nice and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. There was plenty of space and room for luggage and the a/c was cold.

 My stay at Hotel de la Ville was truly outstanding. A hidden gem. The staff were incredibly helpful, my room was VERY comfortable and the breakfast buffet was fresh with ample selection. Perhaps the greatest attribute of the hotel is its location - within easy walk of all of the major sights and on the BEST shopping street in Florence. I would highly recommend the hotel and would return again.

 Not bad for low budget hotel near I95. 1st room had a moldy/musty odor. Night desk clerk happily changed it to the room next door, which wasn't as musty. Decor is old and carpeting, curtains, and bed-spread should be updated to give a cleaner look/feel. The in-room safe was locked so you can't use it(that's why they didn't charge the 5/night fee). There's also some meeting/convention rooms that are used by church and tour groups. Fortunately groups eat in a separate breakfast area. Breakfast was very basic. Inside is a car rental shop. The business center is in the hallway. Front desk provided cookies at night and coffee/water in the hallway. The non-front doors weren't secured by room key access alone, rather they were open to anyone who wanted to wander in. The room door was not neatly lined up with the door jamb, but the lock worked. There were also a lot of student groups staying to visit DC- they were loud and noisy at night but eventually went to sleep. There is ample parking. They share a shuttle van to Springfield Franconia Metro station with the Wyndham next door, which may have been a bit nicer hotel. I probably won't stay there again. But not bad if just passing through a need a bed to crash on- which was comfortable. But the room looked old and dirty.

 Hotel is under construction. My room smelled like urine. Breakfast is advertised until 10:00 I think. but all the food was gone by 7:30. They had no itention of bringing out more. With the hotel being under construction you would think they would make up for it by having at least a good and well stocked breakfast.I would have said something but I only stayed long enough to sleep there. Beds were comfortable and rate was ok. I think once the hotel is done it will be better.

 When ckecking in the clerk was rude, we arrived later at nite and asked for more pillows the nite clerk was watching tv, she gave us pillows and we had to put on the pillowcases, (the pillows were stained). The room was cold so we turned on the heater only to have the fire alarm go off, we had to open the window because the room stunk so bad. Called the front desk and was told was because the heater hadnt been used yet, and was told that she would bring us a portable heater, we waited for about a 1/2 hour and finally called down to front desk and her reply was she was she was doing bookwork and had forgotten. She then called us back and told us that she couldnt find one, we were told to take fire alarm apart and try it again. We didnt want to chance anything getting thing broken, we were told that the manager would call us in the morning and he never did. Upon checking out we asked if there would be any compensation and were told that because we had spent the nite and didnt leave that we still owed full price (we didnt have any other options).

 We were in town for one night for a wedding and made the last minute decision to stay overnight instead of driving back home. This was a just down the street from the wedding site, so we decided to try it. Unfortunately the room smelled horrible of stale cigarette smoke, there were stains on the wall and a big hole in the bathroom wall, hair on the pillows and the TV did not work at all! Plus when we arrived their internet was down so there was no way for them to see our paid reservation and I ended up having to contact hotels.com to then contact the motel to confirm everything. The nighttime attendant Marcus was as helpful as he could be, but overall a terrible experience.

Had to go to spa to find out services rates etched and even then they had nothing to take away. Spa was fully booked out for all of our 4 night stay do couldn't use though we wished to.

But, the hotel was close to family members we were in town to visit, so that was nice.

The front desk staff were quite nice, but it really wasn't a relaxing place to stay.

 This hotel was a bit of a distance from actual Venice. It wasn't a problem though because it was right near the bus stop that took you there. The breakfast was amazing and the staff was beyond friendly. I found the bathroom a little strange, but it was nothing to dislike the hotel over. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were more or less quiet. I would absolutely stay here again.

 I was expecting a typical Kimpton stay - wine and hors d'oeurves at 5 pm in the "living room", but found out when we got there they didn't do that because of some ABC laws in Alexandria - though the Embassy Suites does offer it. Room service breakfast was quite expensive... On the flip side - the location cannot be beat - right on the free trolley route and close to all Old Town Alexandria awesomeness!!!

 The front desk did not acknowledge us even when we wanted to check in, and did not acknowledge us for the entirety of our stay, the only time they even bothered to look up from their phones or laptops was when my boyfriend walked in with his Navy Uniform, they thanked him for his service and continued whatever they were doing. The woman who cleaned our room was very friendly, and our room was cleaned every day of our stay, regardless of what time we left the hotel. The tub had a hard time draining, but all other appliances worked well. The room only smelled strange when the AC was left off for too long. The area is next to a couple of small shopping centers. Over all, it was not a terrible stay but I will probably not be returning.

 We did not feel welcomed from the moment we carried our luggage in without an offer of help and same when we departed. The employees did not go out of their way for us, but, opened the door for people behind us and helped them with their luggage. The hill view was a back view of the parking lot. There were some hills and trees, but, you had to stretch over the balcony and look left. There were nerds on the carpet which tells me that the room was not very clean. I am so disappointed as I took my daughter there to celebrate her birthday and I thought this would be a special experience. Also, the jacuzzi is locayed in the adult pool area so we could not enjoy that either, because, I did not want to leave my daughter alone while i enjoyed the jacuzzi alone. We will not be going back.

 The room was comfortable for the price. Hot Breakfast was a plus and the first morning was staffed by a very friendly gal named Pena. She was always making sure the food was restocked and to our liking. she was GREAT! The following morning was a different server and the eggs were watery, and the sausage gravy was really runny. Not appetizing at all. The attendant was a bit frantic at how busy it was and just told everyone to microwave the eggs to congeal them, she had to keep the people feed. We were also disappointed to see there wasn't a whirlpool, but the kids tried to enjoy the pool. It was far, far too cold in the pool room and impossible for anyone to tolerate. For the price, we thought whatever, but I wouldn't choose this particular hotel again, unless the changed a few things.

 The suite was very comfortable and the room in excellent shape. I also notice the cleanliness of caulking and grout. Hyatt place is as good as the best I've seen. The room was quiet and the HVAC was silent. I was disappointed to not get a bathtub in the king bed room, but the shower was large and, as I've said, very clean. Breakfast was delicious. We were up a little late and didn't get down until close to 9 AM, so the pancakes were a little dry. But, the breakfast sandwiches were delicious. Nice selection of juices, including tomato juice, and delicious coffee. Matt at the check-in desk was very helpful and cordial. Definitely a place I would want to stay again.

 We stayed at this property to attend an event about 20 miles away. It's close to the highway, which was convenient for us. Room was quite comfortable and had relatively new furnishings. However, upon arrival we were greeted by a large roll away bed standing on end (i.e., it blocked part of the entry and wouldn't have fit in room if it were set up). When I went to front desk to see about having it removed, I had to wait about 10 minutes for desk person who apparently was only staff person on duty and was working desk and dealing with room issues - she went with me to room to remove bed. Also, lobby was a little iffy - lobby restroom was not clean and, there was a carpet runner in the lobby that was really several pieces of leftover wall-to-wall remnants that had been hand cut - a bit tacky and a tripping hazard. Finally, a couple had a huge, screaming fight in the middle of the night, which I found quite disturbing because I was concerned it could turn violent - not hotel's fault but still... Would return but probably only if there is no other option.

The cleaning staff is consistent in restocking the room correctly. 30 min from the DC mall area. Overall I would not hesitate to stay again.

 Decent Stay Everything you've read about the elevators is true. The hotel is in a good location, close to everything including the annoying crowds in Times Square. It's convenient to many subways. I appreciated the amenities, such as the fitness center and the business center. The room lacked visual appeal but was huge by NYC standards. Staff was very courteous. A decent value if you can book for under 200/night.

 This was a nice stay for the most part however, I think the room could have been cleaner. I needed to move one of the dressers, and there were a lot of dust bunnies and some dead bugs behind it. Also, you could hear pipes banging in the wall in the room I was in which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others. I didn't know what it was at first, so I asked the guy at the front desk to come check it out. He was very helpful and nice. All the staff were very friendly. However, I will probably not be staying at another AmericInn and cannot recommend it due to the 100 dollar authorization hold that took about a week to come off of my bank account. I've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel. All in all it was a minor inconvenience and did not break the bank for me, but I don't think a hold needs to last that long. I called AmericInn about it, and the lady on the phone told me that it depends on however you paid and that it can take 3-10 days for the hold to come off. I think AmericInn should definitely look into this and expedite the process so people don't have money tied up in a hold.

 I have stayed here several times and it's my usual place to go in San Jose. The front desk guy rushed out to greet me, they are always nice that way, and insisted on taking me to see the room when I expressed doubt about the freeway-facing room. They are adding lanes to I-5 and building a new onramp on the gigantic slope which faces the hotel. You can hear the beeping of the machines all day but somewhat muffled if you have the fan ON (not auto). So I guess I can't complain although it is such a horrible noise and you don't want to open the door to the tiny balcony. Breakfast is fine, staff are all pleasant, it just seems expensive at 145 when it's never full that I've ever seen. Beds are fine, even pillows not bad.

 Nice hotel and not as busy as others in diamant. Breakfast was good but limited other options particularly for kids. Getting to the hotel is not ideal as there is are security checkpoints and very slow staff who don't care if they keep you waiting for ridiculous amounts of time. Very unusual that the hotel did not have a booklet in the room explaining any of its services or facilities or with any information on Acapulco thus left to figure out restaurant hours, pool times, internet on my own. Not sure how you order room service without a menu but front desk staff could only provide info on the spa. Beach was pretty empty, likely due to the armed guard kicking non guests off that part of the beach. Pools were nice but if you have mobility issues there are many stairs and it would not be a fun experience. Due to limited kids food choices, asked about recommendations from front desk only to be directed to another restaurant in another hotel that was closed at lunch - not helpful.

 Check-in was great, and although we arrived early we were upgraded to a ready suite. Great first impression! Breakfast was very nice, with both the standard Holiday Inn Express fare and some nice additional surprises that provided a home-cooked quality. Staff members (sometimes as many as five or six) too often congregate to smoke on a bench located in the hotel's front driveway, adjacent to the front door. This does not provide a good first (or second or third) impression to guests, and the hotel management should definitely find a more secluded place for the ladies to smoke.

They helped with directions, refunded my money (no questions asked) when I lost money in the vending machine and gave me a bottle of water so I didn't have to try again with the machine.The bad... the rooms were super run down.  The hotel looked dirty and old.  I was afraid to recharge my phone because sparks came out of the outlets.  The breakfast food was not good.  The breakfast room was filled with smoke from the buring waffle maker.  No fruit, no yogurt... nothing healthy and awful coffee.  I ended up going out for breakfast, fortunately eateries were close by.

 The room was dingy and gross. The couch was stained and ripped. The linens were not as pictured online and were actually much older. The bed and couch were both uncomfortable. The front desk staff was uninterested in helping us find a restaurant or bar open when we got in around 9:30. Their only suggestion was Dominos, and the phone number listed in the book was the wrong Dominos and didn't service the hotel. The only positive aspect to this hotel was the free airport shuttle. I wouldn't even recommend this place to in-laws that I hate.

 We very much appreciated the welcome note and complimentary wine and treats in honor of our anniversary. The hotel staff were consistently polite and helpful. And the hotel is very conveniently located. But if we'd known that this place was going to be overrun with dogs, we'd have booked in somewhere else, like the sister property Lorien (where we've enjoyed staying before). You really should highlight to potential guests that dogs and cats are allowed at this property, so those of us who have allergies or just don't enjoy having animals up close and personal can have advance notice of the situation here. At least give patrons the option of booking a pet-free room!

 Top of Time Square At check in I asked for an up grade to city view room. 37th floor over looking Times Square. Accommadations were great. Room was big with Fantastic view of the city. Staff were very friendly. Checked out the top View lounge which rotates and the 8th floor bar which I thought was the better of the two. Martinis were hugh. One draw back was the Elevator system.

They told me they were call someone and they meet me. It was close to a 30 minute wait (and it seemed like she came by chance). And she never apologized for the wait. She complained the whole time about hotel.com and that they were really fully booked (though she did find a room that was booked the next night). I was like that was perfect as I would be checking out in the morning. I will never be back

 HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!! The front desk staff and hotel management is disorganized and unprofessional. We had our wedding ceremony here and when family called to check in, the front desk had no idea what they were talking about. In the end, I had to book some of the rooms myself for family, and "no rooms were booked under the wedding party name" as the front fesk informed me. They double booked the bride and grooms rooms. They quoted us one rate and changed it when we checked out. When we talked to the management about it, he accused us of making up rates and offered us an insulting $10 off our rooms after we (bride and groom) had spent over $1400 there in two days, not counting the 10+ rooms booked for at least two nights each by friends and family.On a health and cleanliness note, we went to use the jacuzzi tub and brown, slimy stuff came out of the jets when we turned them on, a clear sign of an inproperly cleaned tub.BAD GUEST SERVICE!!!!

 This is not the hotels fault but I'm not sure the management can do anything, but I wanted to bring attention to it. There were several homeless men on the benches on the boardwalk, in front of the hotel. They didn't bother anyone except one night we were walking by and one of them got sick and just leaned his head over and vomited next to the bench. It was quite disgusting, we had just eaten dinner. I have an aversion to seeing and hearing people getting sick and this was quite gross. The complimentary breakfast, popcorn and lemonade in the afternoon and the pancakes in the evening. Staff was very friendly. Loved that the hotel was oceanfront.

 The Red Roof Inn is a great, convenient place to stay when in Erie. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable. The air conditioner in our room was having trouble keeping the room cool, and parking can be somewhat of a problem at night especially if you are in the second building. The hotel does not offer a breakfast, however they do offer free vouchers for breakfast at McDonald's which is within walking distance next door to the hotel.

 The Anglers Inn is an older property with nice rooms, but only double beds they move when you breath. There is only one trash can rather than one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom. The internet is worse than not having any access I couldn't stay on long enough to send two emails. The shower is ok. The lady who checked us in was very nice. It is over-priced, but so is everything else in Jackson.

 Where to start... First, mildew in shower, dead roach in room, screw on the floor, phone broke and unplugged from wall, and the door stop was broke. Reported this the next morning to the front desk. I informed him about what happened and he said he would bring it up to a manager that was not there on the weekends and I could call back to speak with them about getting the room charges refunded because honestly, who would pay 100 a night to stay in a DUMP!. I called Tuesday morning to speak with the manager and she said she would make a few phone calls and call me back. In her words, probably not today but definitely by tomorrow. Thursday afternoon rolls around and never heard from her. Called back and the Assistant manager picked up and said she had left for the day. I told him she was supposed to call me back and never did. He said he would personally make sure she got my number and returned my call. Didn't hear from her Friday or Monday and then called again on Tuesday. The manager picked up and said, oh yes, Mr. , Sorry, its been too long now for us to do anything more for you. I said that is because you never called me back and her response was, well, I have been busy. Will NEVER go back to that hotel and am reporting this to Choice Hotels directly!

 I chose this hotel because of price and walking distance to the convention center. The beach would not have been a far walk but I was here for business. I travel a lot and this was a quality room for the price. There is a lot of traffic in the area, being a tourist spot, so you hear that in the evening but it was quiet at night. I never tried the restaurant that is connected to the lobby. I would definitely stay here again.

 This was the ONLY hotel room available in town that night. It's old, run down, sketchy. The smell of smoke permeates the hallways, the rooms. You have to pull all top bedding off the bed out of fear it's not been laundered. The man checking me in and lady checking me out at front desk were pleasant, but not overly. I couldn't wait to leave and thankful I was only in need of some sleep a shower.

 I must say this is a very nice hotel. It has a very historic feel to it without it being creepy, just elegant. I stayed in the Penthouse Terrace Suite with my girlfriend and it was very memorable and romantic. And don't let the word penthouse and suite scare you. It was a very good value, only 280 which is a steal in any big city for this caliber of hotel. It was on the highest floor in a newly renovated west wing. The room was beautiful, the views amazing, and very comfortable. What really surprised me during my stay was that when I was walking through the lobby a day after I checked in the bellman still knew my name. This is a wonderful place to stay as I felt I was very welcome. Plus it's only a few blocks from all the major shopping and sight seeing in Portland. This hotel made me love Portland even more than before.

The room was also so well decorated and plush, with a big desk. The pool is indoors and it's like a greenhouse in there. The pool is also very small. The metro is a good mile walk, but everything else is right there including a nice French bistro we ate breakfast at every day, and a short 5 or 6 minutes to the water. I wish they had more Kimpton hotels-- I would definitely stay again.

 The accommodations and amenities were not what we were used to as we had to make reservations last minute due to death in the family. Thought that the hot/cold breakfast buffet would have included more of a variety but the stay was exceptional because of the way that the staff responded to our arrival, needs and departure. We did not run into one problem that could not be addressed with pleasantness! No matter the request, it was meet by willingness and genuine concern for our needs. I had never heard of this hotel before this stay but because of the staff I have already recommended this hotel to colleagues and friends. Thanks for a pleasant stay!

 If you need a bathroom and bed, it's a fine place to stay. And it's about the only place in miles. Sam at the desk was congenial. Many rooms face the highway so if you are bothered by traffic noise, request a room in the back. The toilets are very low. Rooms are cleaned with a fragrance-scented something so if you are smell-sensitive, that might be an issue. Room had a fridge and microwave, which was handy for the leftover Godfather's Pizza from next door. There were a variety of pillow softnesses. One matresses was extremely soft, the other a nice firmness. Could use more hooks and a hanidcap bar in the shower/bathroom.

 The outside of the hotel needs work. There are ceiling tiles missing outside of the room doors. The lobby appeared to be newly redone and was very comfortable. The security was exceptional. Having to use the room key to access the elevator is a big plus. However, once the elevator doors opened up on the third floor, I was very disappointed. The carpets were old and tattered, especially where the carpet was pieced together. I took a picture of the carpet but am unable to take it off my phone. Once we entered our room, it was very small for two adults, a twelve year old boy, and his cousin who was a seven year old girl. We had brought an inflatable mattress for the seven year old girl to sleep on and we were unable to set it up. So, we had to make different sleeping arrangements because I was uncomfortable with the cousins sleeping together. The bed that I slept in was very uncomfortable. I woke up with a backache every morning. I will not be recommending this hotel to anyone.

The price was good and I would stay again just made sure I was in a first floor room in the main house. We had to walk across the street to go to the pool or even get ice.

The king deluxe room I stayed in was very spacious and the bed was ultra comfortable. My room also overlooked the courtyard which was a nice touch. There was a little snafu regarding when I wanted my room cleaned but the manager Michael did make sure that the situation was rectified immediately. That was the only hiccup I experienced during my stay. I felt like royalty when I left and entered the hotel. The doorman always greeted me with a smile and welcomed me back to the hotel. I love where the hotel is located in Old Town. There are so many shops, bars and restaurants no matter if you walk to the right or left. I felt very safe even walking at night. It is a quaint town with lots of charm. I will definitely be staying at Hotel Monaco again in the very near future. I cannot wait to visit during spring and summer when it is beautiful enough to enjoy a cocktail sitting in the courtyard.

 Hotel is pet friendly but the rooms have a terrible ordor. Had to request a room change because the odor was so bad. My second room had no less than 20 flies in the window behind the drapes.

 Hotel in buona posizione per poter visitare l'isola e con suites all'altezza delle aspettative sia per lo spazio sia per la pulizia. Personale disponibile e gentile.Peccato per il ristorante che a pranzo e a cena propone quasi sempre le stesse cose con un men prettamente per inglesi e con molto fritto presente soprattutto nel men per i bambini.

 I stay in hotels in the area every week for my job. I usually stay in Burlingame but could not find a decent priced room so I thought I'd give Hotel Aura a try after reading the reviews. When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the front desk clerk who checked in me in quickly. When I entered my room on the third floor, it smelled nice and was very spacious. What I was most impressed with was how clean it was. I did't find anything that wasn't clean! I only had two issues with the room. The bed was rock hard my back was killing me the next day. Also, the walls are thin. My neighbor kept me up until 1am but to be fair, I don't sleep well in hotels. I would recommend this hotel it you want a well appointed, clean room. I already have a room reserved for next week.

He said that hed sent away at least 20 people before me. Nevertheless he went out of his way to find a vacant room for me. The staff was very courteous. The room was small and a bit worn but it suited its purpose for the price. Id stay there again.

 I stayed in this hotel for four nights in June 2016. I thought it was good value for what was offered. Nice breakfast buffet, clean (although pretty dated) room), access to central Torremolinos. The hotel was actually a lot like a cruise ship with organized activities, entertainment, and music playing at the pool. These activities made the hotel a bit noisy from the pool facing room I had. Especially since I was sleeping at strange hours due to jet lag. I'm sure it's nice if you're looking for that type of thing but it became a bit annoying having bands playing, bingo, or fitness classes always going over the speakers when I wanted to sleep. Other than that, I enjoyed and would stay again if I needed a nice cheap, clean, convenient spot in Torremolinos.

 If your looking for a place to crash for a night you could stay at worst. You need to park in the back and no elevator to your room. So don't bring alot of luggage. Entering and exiting is confusing because exit doors look like hotel room doors. Besides low price nothing to rave about. Looks like a room in the 70's. Bathroom was clean but all the piping old. Terrible shower heads and constant drip in my tub in my room. Stay away from room 108 if running water will bother you. Plus make sure you call for towels. Only 2 to a room so if you bring your wife there won't be a towel for you if she washes her hair. Stay here only if you need to emergency crash somewhere

 Expectations are always low when it comes to the Florida Keys. It's a beautiful place but if you are paying less than 200/night you can expect Motel-6-esk accommodations. That's precisely what you get at Sombrero. The Venetian blinds were falling down, closet was broken, toilet wax ring needed replaced, and the list goes on. Maintenance doesn't seem to be a high priority here, but the front-desk folks were kind.

 The dining room was always clean and well organized. The meals seemed well rounded and good portion sizes. The facility provided assistance for residents needing it as well as more private setups for residents that needed less help. The apartment setup offered residents the opportunity to maintain a private lifestyle that did not confine them to a hospital room- it felt more like home. The staff was always friendly and upbeat, whether they were greeting you at the door or helping a resident. The facility often provided activities and social opportunities for residents to listen to music, hear stories, go shopping, and participate in performances and religious programs. There was also a pool for residents to exercise and get outside. I felt safe with my elderly relative here as the staff could provide medical help which was needed for her a few times. We felt assured she had opportunities to stay busy and active while still taken care of while in her more fragile state.

 Not a pleasant stay at all - when I checked in I was not told I was being giving and ADA room, and didn't get to the room until after meetings and dinner - it was about 11:30 and I was settled in when I realized there was not an actual shower. I called the front desk and was told - well what would you like me to do. Changing rooms was apparently not an option. I finally attempted to use the shower and the drain didn't work and water flooded all over the bathroom. I then used the incredibly tattered towels to attempt to mop up the bathroom. Someone should have informed me that I was being giving and ADA room...and then imagine if you were in a wheelchair and had to use a flooding bathroom! Disgusting and disappointing. Will never stay there again.

 My husband and our two small kids decided it would be fun to stay at the Hilton one weekend to swim, eat, and relax.  We were quite surprised to see how much they do NOT cater to families!  It is very much geared toward convention goers.  There was not even any kids meal items on the menu for room service.  The pool area floor was incredibly slippery and wet.  If you are travelling without kids, it may be OK, but not for families.

 walked in the room and smelled gas. the oven pilot was lite with no flames. killed 4 cockroaches on the way back to the door. went to the front desk and told them the gas was on and that i killed 4 cockroaches for them but would to turn on the AC so the whole hotel would not blow up. 15 minutes later a man knocked at the door saying he was with pest control, i gladly let him in and stepped outside. He left and an hour later i decided to turn the oven on to fix my dinner, a mouse ran out from under the oven and into a hole near the baseboard of the kitchen. I packed up and called another hotel and checked out within 2 hours upon arrival. the next day while at work i looked down and a roach was crawling on my uniform. on the way home while driving a roach crawled out of my AC duct. Guess they were not happy with their last place of residence either and decided to travel along with me. Need i say they met with unfortunate disaster which resulted in their death.

 I arrived at the hotel well before check in and was informed that I could either wait about 45 minutes for the room I booked or get a room with smaller beds immediately. I chose to wait. I went to the Red Rock Cafe during my wait and ate their delicious brunch and took advantage of their bottomless mimosas. It was not even 20 minutes later that I was informed my room was ready. I booked a king guestroom with a city view and it was clean and spacious. The hotel was very prompt with my requests for more towels and an issue with the air conditioner, which was resolved in about only 10 minutes. Overall, my experience was excellent. The pool was fantastic, the service prompt and the employees are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here in the future!

 The hotel was what you would expect from a Residence Inn, however our room was not up to par. The air conditioning did not work properly and the ice maker in the fridge was broken too. Also, Residence Inn needs to scale up the quality of their breakfast. They compete directly with Embassy Suites, but Embassy Suites does a much better job with their breakfast offerings and quality. I will go there next time.

Paper products (TP, facial tissue) are of inferior quality. Breakfast was mediocre, but there are many restaurants in the area to find a decent breakfast. Although this is a non smoking hotel, cigar smoke was very evident one evening on the 2nd floor.

 We have stayed in many places with Hotels.com and by far this was no where near our expectations from previous stays. First off, for the price we paid at 286.00 per night ( on sale ) you would expect at the very least a half decent room. The place was dirty outside and inside the room. The bath room and shower was filthy with dirt and dusty. The we were itching all night and could not get any rest because we felt things crawling and biting. Very disappointing to say the least.

 Hotel is in a PERFECT location, walking distance to everything worth visiting in the old city AND Galata. Room is fine although small, mattress is decent. Overall the hotel does its job properly, provided you are not expecting anything too fancy. In my room there was quite an audible noise coming from the building's air conditioning, it didn't bother me but might be a nuisance for a light sleeper. Breakfast is quite good. There is also a perfectly fine english pub attached to the hotel, even though I can't for the life of me figure out why anybody would want to go to an english pub while in Turkey - it was constantly packed so who am I to say anything anyway.

 Me and my son drove 15.5 hours from portland oregon to miles city, we were very tired and pulled into the econo lodge in miles city MT. we had booked our stay thru Expedia.com so everything was already paid for and set up. we got to our room and unpacking and noticed debris on the carpet no big deal we got our swimsuits on and walked to the pool there was no hotub to relax in after a long day. swimming pool was very cold so i went back to our room.i was getting ready to take a shower and noticed more debris between the bed and the was, at this time in the day i was spent,i took a shower and went to bed. i kept thinking about the dirty carpets and was not able to get to sleep for about three hours and finally was able to get to sleep around 1am and got up at 6:30 I noticed red mark on my feet,some type of bug was living in my bed. the only good thing out of the stay is a full refund. i was not the only one to complain about the filth and bed bugs gross. never again.

 The most amazing feat this hotel has accomplished is the number of returning customers. I met a few while play volley and ping pong with the excellent animation crew, all guests complementary of food, staff and ocean view spacious rooms. Oh the beach, 5 meters away, plus the hot water pool, total relax. Bus stop facing the shopping center, 50 meters away and 1.40 euros fare from airport. I love you Elba!

 When we checked in we were told we were upgraded - not sure exactly what that upgrade meant. Perhaps it meant upgraded to the second floor from the first. The room wasn't a suite or particularly large, but it was comfortable enough. It was freezing in the room, but with some time with the heater on it became comfortable. The TV was SMALL and one lamp was missing a bulb. The bed was really comfortable. The biggest issue was that the door did not close or lock properly. You would shut it and it could look closed and seem locked, but if you jiggled the handle it would pop open - not safe. We finally just slammed the door really hard when we left and hoped for the best. Also, we thought about swimming but the pool in the basement was dark and really creepy. Not to mention you had to go outside to get there, so even though it was an indoor pool, you would have to get back to your room in the cold. The staff was nice and the hotel is decently located. Be careful in the parking lot - it's a steep incline and there wasn't adequate salt/sand on the ice.

 My husband and I loved this sweet little place. The staff was friendly, the room was so cute and cozy and we were close to everything we wanted to do. We had a balcony off our room that looked out on a courtyard which made us feel like we were in a treehouse and there was free, convenient parking. The only negative things were that the seagulls were crazy noisy outside and since this is an old building we heard them clearly and the bed was too firm for our liking.

 We stayed here for our trip to DragonCon. We specifically picked this hotel because of the great rate on Hotels.com, and the close proximity to the MARTA station. when we arrived, we were given a king bedroom, but it didn't include a sofa bed, which is what we specifically booked since there were three of us sharing. The staff quickly remedied the situation and got us in the correct style of room. The room was very clean and comfy. The shower is a bit strange in that the glass only goes halfway across, so water spills out and soaks the floor/bathmat. Also, there's not much space to put your shampoo, etc. The continental breakfast was pretty standard, but our one complaint is that they didn't always have everything set up by the time breakfast started. The area around is pretty quiet, and you are within walking distance to the Perimeter mall and another shopping center with a grocery store and restaurants. All in all, it was a great hotel and we would definitely consider staying there again in the future.

 We checked into the hotel and I should have known we were in trouble when the clerk asked me to go look at the room to say it was ok before he checked us in.  The room was small, and shabby, but it was almost midnight and the area that the hotel was in did not look bad, I said OK to the room.  They only gave us one towel, and no washcloth, my husband went to ask for more and they only had one to give us.  The sheets were wrinkled and gray, and I saw a cockroach in the bathtub.  There also were very poor patch jobs done on the walls where someone had knocked a hole in the wall, and the next door neighbor had what sounded liked a big and vicious dog.  On the second night there, we saw 7 cop cars when we got back from our evening activities, and about 1:00 a.m. there was a knock on our door.  We did not answer it and someone knocked again.  This time my husband said "who is it?" and there was a bit of a commotion outside the door and no one answered.  I called the front desk and told them what was going on and the person who answered the phone said "It might have been the SWAT team, there is a bit of a situation going on here, they may want you to evacuate and come to the front office."  Then he put me on hold and came back to the phone and said "no you are in a different part of the hotel, just stay put and call me if anyone comes to your door again."  We later heard what sounded like gun shots, about 5 times.  Then all was quiet.  Needless to say the next morning we checked ou

 We originally booked for 2 nights. We decided we wanted to add a night on but they didn't have our room available for 3 nights. So we did one night in one room and two in the other. It didn't bother me. The hotel staff was fantastic. They called me at 10 am on Friday to tell me that my main room was ready and they made sure the room was close so it wasn't too hard to transfer our belongings. It was clean and a lot of amenities. The pool was a perfect temperature and the court yard was great. House keeping did a great job and the free breakfast buffet was a huge bonus. Overall we enjoyed our experience and would definitely stay here again!

 Great breakfast, especially the biscuits and gravy and sausage. Staff was excellent. Hotel was clean and comfortable...it just needs a little updating and some repairs.

 My husband and I stayed over this Valentine's Day weekend with our 4 year old son and another family with a son the same age. From the moment we walked into the lobby with the most amazing scent, we knew it would be a great weekend. The staff are absolutely on par with what we expect at The Four Seasons.... More
